This is a classical email site, which will help you connect to the world.

This will help you create labels, add labels to emails, and sort them accordingly.
You can delete and archive emails.

There is a dictionary feature in the application powered by the [Google Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/). You can use the dictionary to find the words in the languages: English, French, German and Spanish.

This website has been made using __React__, __React DOM__ and __React Router DOM__.

If you want to run the code from your editor by downloading it, you can install the following things using `npm`.

```npm install parcel react react-router-dom```

Run the code using `npm run start` (see package.json).

### How the code works:
- The emails are opened using Dynamic web addresses in __React Router DOM__.

__Hope you like my application.__
